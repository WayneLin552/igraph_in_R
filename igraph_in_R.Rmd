```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# this prevents package loading message from appearing in the rendered version of your problem set

```


## 1. igraph Basics

First we download and install the package.

```{r}
#install.packages('igraph')  #remove '#' when you first download it.
library(igraph)
```


We will use an open source data set named 'phone.call' from 'navdata'.

```{r}
library(devtools)
#install_github('kassambara/navdata') #remove '#' when you first download it.
library(navdata)
data("phone.call")
head(phone.call)
```
### 1.1 Create igraph Network Object
igraph has its specific network (graph) object called 'igraph'. The simplest way to create a 'igraph' is using graph.formula() to type every node and edge into it.
```{r}
graph.formula()
```
